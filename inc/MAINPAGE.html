<p>Documentation for the publicly exported interfaces
    to the libraries provided by the Farsyte Toolkit.</p>

<h2>A Note on Namespaces</h2>

<p>All interfaces live within the <code>Farsyte</code> namespace, to avoid
    collisions with simiarly named things defined elsewhere.</p>

<h1>Header File Overview</h1>

<h2>Farsyte::Utility "utility.h"</h2>

<p>The <code>utility.h</code> header collects general utility code that
    is not associated with any of the larger packages within
    the toolkit project. This could be code that is shared
    across multiple packages (without an obvious owner), or it
    could be entire packages that are simply too small to
    warrant tracking as their own library.</p>

<h2>Farsyte::Testing "testing.h"</h2>

<p>The <code>testing.h</code> header provides declarations for the API
    for the library that is used to record test results in a
    form that allows an automated build system (currently the
    Bamboo continuous intergration system from Atlassian) to
    track testing results.</p>

<p>The <code>Testing</code> Library implements four classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Testing_1_1Oops.html">Oops</a> class
        is the base class for exceptions thrown within
        the <code>Testing</code> library representing failures of
        the library or failure to follow the requirements
        of the library when calling it.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Testing_1_1Test.html">Test</a> class
        represents a single test, counting as one test when presenting
        counts of tests passed or failed. Tests may indicate one or more
        conditions that fail or were skipped, with supporting text, as
        well as errors occurring in the testing process.
        It is not uncommon for a Test to correspond to a single method
        name within a class, and for the code to test various aspects of
        the method in sequence.
        If two Test objects have the same test name and the same suite
        name, their results will be combined during reporting.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Testing_1_1Suite.html">Suite</a> class
        represents a collection of Test objects that are logically
        related; tests with the same Suite name are grouped together when
        reporting summaries of test results.
        It is not uncommon for a Suite to correspond to a single Class to
        be tested within a library.
        If two Suite objects have the same name, their results will be
        combined during reporting (even if they come from tests in quite
        different subprojects). Risks associated with this can be
        mitigated by assuring that class names are distinct between
        subprojects of a superproject, when tests are run across the
        entire superproject as a unit.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Testing_1_1Log.html">Log</a> class
        corresponds to a single stream of test output produced by
        sequentially running a series test suites, each of which
        sequentially runs a series of test cases. Note that the Log class
        allows test programs to have multiple Log objects open at once,
        allowing a test program to persue multiple test series in parallel
        if this is appropriate and useful.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Farsyte::Matrix "matrix.h"</h2>

<p>Matrix math is provided as a genearlized template for dense
    rectangular matrices, a derived template for working with column
    vectors, and a class representing a position in a three dimensional
    state space (such as distance north, east, and above the flagpole).</p>

<p>The <code>Matrix</code> Library implements two templates and one class:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Matrix_1_1Matrix.html">Matrix</a> class
        template supports dense rectangular matrices with any small
        positive integer number of rows and columns, containing data
        elements of any data type that supports the desired operations.
        This class currently provides class methods retrieving the
        dimensions of the matrix, and member methods providing the
        operations listed here. More operations will be added once I am
        happy with code quality, test coverage, and documentation for
        these operations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Initialization</li>
            <li>Addition</li>
            <li>Difference</li>
            <li>Negation</li>
            <li>Transpose</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Matrix_1_1Colvec.html">ColVec</a> class template
        is a proxy class providing the obvious API adjustments to use
        for column vectors, which are simply a one-column matrix.
        The API differences mainly involve not having to redundantly
        specify column numbers when working with a ColVec class.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <a href="classFarsyte_1_1Matrix_1_1ThreeVec.html">ThreeVec</a> class
        likewise provides for a three-element column vector such as might
        be used to represent a Position (north, east and above the
        flagpole), Velocity, Direction, and so on.
        The <code>ThreeVec</code> class adds the Cross Product operation, which is
        not provided for general Matrix and Column Vector objects.</p></li>
</ul>
