.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSuite\fP Object\&. 

The \fBSuite\fP object constructor writes appropraite opening text to the XML output stream\&. The destructor writes appropriate text to the XML stream to close the XML element corresponding to the suite\&. It is an error to construct a \fBSuite\fP object for a \fBLog\fP that currently has an active \fBSuite\fP object; be sure that each \fBSuite\fP object goes out of scope before the next one is constructed\&.

\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIref\fP - \fBLog\fP that contains this \fBSuite\fP\&. 
.br
\fIname\fP - what to call this \fBSuite\fP\&. Generates appropriate header text to the XML text output stream to start a new suite\&. May throw an exception if there is already an existing \fBSuite\fP associated with the specified \fBLog\fP\&.

.PP

.SS "Farsyte::Testing::Suite::~Suite ()"

.PP
\fBSuite\fP Destructor\&. Generates an appropriate trailer to the XML text output stream to close the \fBSuite\fP\&. May throw an exception if it appears that this is not the current \fBSuite\fP associated with the \fBLog\fP\&.
